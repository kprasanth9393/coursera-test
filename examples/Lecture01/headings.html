		There were 198 riders from 22 teams on the initial startlist of the 2015 Giro d'Italia, the first of cycling's Grand Tours to take place in the 2015 road cycling season. It was the 98th edition of the Giro d'Italia, with the race starting on 9 May in San Lorenzo al Mare and ending on 31 May in Milan. The 17 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited and obliged to attend the race. In October 2014, five UCI Professional Continental teams were awarded wildcard places in the race by RCS Sport, the organisers of the Giro, to complete the 22-team peloton. As LottoNLâ€“Jumbo's George Bennett was forced to withdraw before the race start due to a blood test that revealed a low level of cortisol, only 197 riders started the first stage. The final stage in Milan was completed by 163 riders, with 34 failing to finish the race. The race was won by Alberto Contador
